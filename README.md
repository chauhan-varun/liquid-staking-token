# 💧 LiquidStakingToken in Solana

LiquidStakingToken is a smart contract-based solution that allows users to participate in staking without locking up their assets. It supports key operations for the **BUND token**, **MINT token**, and **native SOL token transfers**, making it easy to earn rewards while maintaining token liquidity.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Stake BUND Token**: Stake your BUND tokens and receive a liquid staking representation.
- ✅ **Mint Functionality**: Allows authorized minting of staking tokens based on deposits.
- ✅ **Send Native SOL**: Enables the sending of the native SOUL token within the staking logic.
- ✅ **Liquid Staking**: Users can stake and unstake without needing to wait for bonding periods.
- ✅ **Tokenized Staking Position**: Stakeholders receive a token that represents their staked position, tradable or usable in DeFi.

## 📦 Supported Tokens

- **BUND** – The main staking token for rewards.
- **MINT** – Represents minted tokens based on BUND deposits.
